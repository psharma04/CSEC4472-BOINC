# CSEC4472 Open Computing
CSEC4472 Joint/Open Computing BOINC/FAH/SheepIt Team

### Just a bunch of people who want to contribute to science, maths and medicine.

### How to join: [guides.rbxii3.net/boinc/](https://guides.rbxii3.net/boinc/)
### NOTE: CSEC4472 Joint and CSEC4472 Open Computing are the SAME GROUP!!! Some of the projects were spitting errors when CSEC4472 Joint was created, so CSEC4472 Open was created to remove the errors.

### We also have a Folding@Home team (Team number 234967).
